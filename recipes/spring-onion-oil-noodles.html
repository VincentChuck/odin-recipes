    <p>Originating in Shanghai, scallion oil noodles (aka spring onion oil noodles, 葱油拌面) is a humble dish with great flavour. In appearance, it’s as simple as can be: boiled noodles coated with a thin, brownish sauce and topped with fried spring onion. However, it can effortlessly excite your taste buds, a true example to prove the concept “Less is more”.</p>
